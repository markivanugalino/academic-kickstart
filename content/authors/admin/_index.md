I am a graduate researcher at the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines Diliman. I was born and raised in **Quezon City, Philippines**. My main research interests are on stellar & planetary astronomy, partial differential equations, and computational physics. Writing poems and short literary works are my ways of exploring the intersection of the sciences and humanities.
