We consider a massive point particle moving along a circular orbit, immersed in a finite cylindrical gaseous environment, as a model for astrophysical compact objects embedded in a gaseous disk. We compute, via a frequency-domain calculation, the density perturbation induced by the gravitational influence of the perturber as a first-approximation to the full hydrodynamical problem.
