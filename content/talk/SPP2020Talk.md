Models describing the dynamical friction experienced by a moving massive object involve an assumption that, throughout its trajectory, the background medium is infinite; that is, the characteristic length of the background is much larger than the orbital radius. However, in most cases, astrophysical objects like planets and stars evolve in gaseous disks whose dimensions are finite. In this thesis, we derived an expression for the hydrodynamical drag experienced by a point particle moving through a finite fluid background with cylindrical symmetry. We assume in this method that the particle has completed several orbits before measuring the force exerted.
