Abstract: Transportation amongst cities is found as one of the main factors which affect the outbreak of diseases. To
understand the effect of transport-related infection on disease spread, an SEIRS (Susceptible, Exposed,
Infectious, Recovered) epidemic model for two cities is formulated and analyzed. The epidemiological
threshold, known as the basic reproduction number, of the model is derived. If the basic reproduction
number is below unity, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Thus, the disease
can be eradicated from the community. There exists an endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically
stable if the reproduction number is larger than unity. This means that the disease will persist
within the community. The results show that transportation among regions will change the disease
dynamics and break infection out even if infectious diseases will go to extinction in each isolated region
without transport-related infection. In addition, the result shows that transport-related infection intensifies
the disease spread if infectious diseases break out to cause an endemic situation in each region, in
the sense of that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase. Further, the formulated model is
applied to the real data of SARS outbreak in 2003 to study the transmission of disease during the movement
between two regions. The results show that the transport-related infection is effected to the number
of infected individuals and the duration of outbreak in such the way that the disease becomes more
endemic due to the movement between two cities. This study can be helpful in providing the information
to public health authorities and policy maker to reduce spreading disease when its occurs.
